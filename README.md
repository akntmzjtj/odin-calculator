# Odin Calculator
Will I be able to create a calculator after all this time?

## What I have done
 - [x] Got numbers to display on the page
 - [x] Calculator logic (basically works now)
 - [x] Added a clear button. That's nice
 - [x] Make the calculator look pretty (ehh)
 - [ ] Divide by zero
 - [ ] User can insert decimal numbers
 - [x] Repeat calculation by pressing `=` button
